Jennifer is a fashion buyer for an international apparel and footwear retailer. She
often finds herself traveling to discover new industry trends. To keep her time
on the road to a minimum, she is enlisting the help of a programmer friend (you)
to help her find the shortest route between her current location and her next
destination.

Your program should accept the following inputs:

1. A list containing the city pairs and the distance between them

For example:

Boston,New York,50

Boston,Hartford,25

Hartford,New York,35

New York,Philadelphia,40

Note that each city pair in the input list should be considered bi-
directional. So (Boston,New York,50) means that it is valid to travel from

Boston to New York at a distance of 50 AND it is also valid to travel from

New York to Boston at a distance of 50.

2. The name of the starting city

For example: Boston

3. The name of the destination city

For example: Philadelphia

Your program should return a list of the cities that comprise the shortest route:

1. For the example above, your program would return:

Boston,New York,Philadelphia

You can write the program in any language you choose. However, Jennifer
needs to be able to run your program on her laptop computer. So in addition to
the source code, you should provide her with documentation on how to compile
and execute your code. Your documentation should also describe what, if any,
testing was performed to verify your solution.
